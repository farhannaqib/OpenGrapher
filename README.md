# OpenGrapher

A graphing visualizer in C++

This is a CLI tool for graphing an equation. By building the `src/` folder, you can input any equation to produce a simple graph for it.

OpenGL 3.3 is used for the front end. In order to build, OpenGL must be installed on a MacOS device.

Below is a graph of `e^(x/3)*sin(3x)`:
